The board is based on ESP8266 ESP-12E variant, unlike other ESP-12E, you won’t need to buy a separate breakout board, usb to serial adapter, or even solder it to a PCB to get started, you will only need a usb cable (Micro USB).

                                      The Nokia 5110 is a basic graphic LCD screen for lots of applications. It was originally intended for cell phone screen. This one is mounted on an easy to solder PCB. It uses the PCD8544 controller, which is the same used in the Nokia 3310 LCD. The PCD8544 is a low power CMOS LCD controller/driver, designed to drive a graphic display of 48 rows and 84 columns. All necessary functions for the display are provided in a single chip, including on-chip generation of LCD supply and bias voltages, resulting in a minimum of external components and low power consumption. The PCD8544 interfaces to microcontrollers through a serial bus interface.

                                    <td>This capacitive soil moisture sensor is distinguished from most resistive sensors on the market and uses capacitive sensing to detect soil moisture. The problem that the resistance sensor is easily corroded is avoided, and its working life is greatly extended. The sensor has a built-in voltage regulator chip that supports a 3.3-volt working environment, which means it works even on a 3.3V Arduino control board. A miniature PC such as the Raspberry Pi only needs an external ADC (analog to digital signal) conversion module to work. With an external screen and a motherboard, you can talk to your plants!
